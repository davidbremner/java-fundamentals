Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?
Answer: It will first print "Parent called" and then print "Child called". This is due object 'c' is an instance of
class Child (and a type of class Parent) but due to inheritance hierarchy the superclass constructor must be invoked
first so the Parent constructor containing "Parent called" will be called and printed and then the "Child called" within
the Child constructor will be called and print that message.



public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
