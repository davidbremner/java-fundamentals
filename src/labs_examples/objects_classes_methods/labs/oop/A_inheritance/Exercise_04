Without running the code below, please tell me what it will print.
Answer: It will print "Child called". This is due to the object 'c' being an instance of Child even though it is of type
Parent. Therefore the method that is called is doSomething() of the Child class which overrides the doSomething() method
in the parent/superclass.


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
    c.doSomething();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
