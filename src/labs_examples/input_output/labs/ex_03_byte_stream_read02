Running out of stuff to write, at least of interest anyway!
Well it is my birthday this week (Thursday) I turn 35, scary stuff! Where has the time gone...
The mighty Toon Army face PSG in the Champions League this Wednesday at St.James' Park, buzzing!
I'll throw my prediction in, the final score will be 3-1 to Newcastle! Early goal by Newcastle (Tonali) then PSG
pull one back at around 38mins (Mbappe) and then second half around 65mins Isak scores and then Bruno/Miggy to wrap it up
on the 83rd minute. Howay the toon!!
